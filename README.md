# Incremental Universe
Yet another incremental game, we bring to you, Incremental Universe!

The story for this game is not yet decided, but here are some of the ideas we have came up with.

[SpiderGamin's](https://gitlab.com/spidergamin) Ideas
- You are all alone on a planet far far away, you’re the only form of life in existence (as you think) and you are going to die soon (because other life is needed to keep you alive). The air is full of gases that you think are the reason you feel sick. The sun is blazing hot, but the air is very cold.

- You are in the middle of space on a spaceship with some of your friends and family trillions of miles away from your home planet, Anzy. All things in existence are fading starting from the center of the universe and you are trying to get as far away from it. Unfortunately Anzy is located in the exact center of the universe at all times. At least you are far away from it. Later, you land on a planet that you will be safe on for a couple of years. All you and the people you brought with you have to do now is to survive on this new planet.

- You wake up in a tomb of some sort with little light you don’t remember anything at all you see strange writing but you can’t make it out there are some instructions on how to get certain items unfortunately it’s in horrible condition you find a video of yourself getting locked away for some unknown reason then you realize this was taken on the year 4556 but the year is 5678 thanks to a clock your goal is to get yourself off the planet and learn more about yourself 

[Alphadrake86's](https://gitlab.com/) Idea (To be given to the player in segments, similar to trimps)
- You wake up on a planet, with no memory of how you got there or even who you are. For some reason, you get the feeling that you should start gathering materials…
- As you gather wood and stones, the memory of how to make tools floods your mind. This will certainly make gathering materials easier, although you’re still unsure why you need to. (Unlocks research tab, as well as shovel and axe research)
This stuff is starting to pile up, and it's getting harder to keep track of it all. As this thought crosses your mind, another memory sears in your head, this time plans for building a storage facility. Where are these memories coming from?
(TBC…)

[ScatterBrain's](https://gitlab.com/) Idea
- You wake up and all you remember is barreling through the space/time continuum and you wake up somewhere and some time you have blueprints but you can’t read them and a Boy Scouts handbook and an astronomical hand book that you don’t understand yet and your first thought is
